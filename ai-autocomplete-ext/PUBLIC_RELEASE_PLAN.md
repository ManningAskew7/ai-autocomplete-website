## 1. Critical Fixes

### 1.1 Custom System Prompt Issue
**Priority:** ✅ COMPLETED

#### Current Problem (FIXED)
- ~~Custom system prompt currently **overrides** the default JSON-enforcing prompts~~
- ~~This breaks the extension's core functionality as responses won't be properly formatted~~
- ~~Users enabling custom prompts will experience complete failure of autocomplete~~

**Status:** Fixed - Custom prompts now append to base prompts instead of replacing them

#### Solution Implementation
```typescript
// In prompts.ts - Modified getSystemPrompt function
export function getSystemPrompt(customPrompt?: string, multipleCompletions: boolean = false, mode: CompletionMode = 'short'): string {
  const basePrompt = multipleCompletions ? getModePrompt(mode) : SINGLE_COMPLETION_PROMPT;
  
  if (customPrompt) {
    // APPEND custom prompt instead of replacing
    return `${customPrompt}\n\nIMPORTANT: After considering the above instructions, ${basePrompt}`;
  }
  
  return basePrompt;
}
```

#### UI Changes Required
- Add warning text: "Custom prompts extend the default behavior and cannot override core formatting requirements"
- Limit custom prompt to 500 characters (premium feature)
- Add example prompts that work well

## 2. Freemium Implementation

### 2.1 Payment Strategy
**Selected Solution:** ExtensionPay (ExtPay.js)
- **Cost:** $0.20 + 3% per transaction
- **Benefits:** No server required, cross-browser support, Stripe integration
- **Alternative:** Custom Stripe implementation (more complex, requires backend)

### 2.2 Feature Breakdown

#### Free Tier (Core Features)
- ✅ All AI models access
- ✅ All completion modes (Short/Medium/Long)
- ✅ Customizable keybinds
- ✅ Temperature adjustment
- ✅ Model selection and search

### 2.3 Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Install ExtensionPay ✅ COMPLETED
```bash

```

#### Step 2: Add to manifest.json ✅ COMPLETED
```json

  "content_security_policy": {
    "extension_pages": "script-src 'self' https://extensionpay.com; object-src 'none'; connect-src 'self' https://extensionpay.com https://api.extensionpay.com"
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: License Verification ✅ COMPLETED
```typescript
// src/utils/licensing.ts - ✅ COMPLETED
import ExtPay from 'extpay';

const extpay = ExtPay('ai-autocomplete-extension'); // TODO: Replace with actual ExtensionPay ID

export async function checkPremiumStatus(): Promise<boolean> {
  const user = await extpay.getUser();
  return user.paid;
}

**Probability:** High (60%)  
**Mitigation:** Clear disclosure, minimal collection, user control

#### Rejection for Broad Permissions
**Probability:** Medium (40%)  
**Mitigation:** Use activeTab, remove <all_urls>(done except for development mode), minimal permissions

#### Payment Integration Failure
**Probability:** Low (20%)  
**Mitigation:** Thorough testing, fallback options

### 9.2 Contingency Plans
- If rejected for privacy: Remove fallback detection, enhance disclosures
- If payment fails: Temporary free access, backup payment provider
